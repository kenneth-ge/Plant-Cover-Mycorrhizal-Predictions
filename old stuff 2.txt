- plotting percent cover of each mycorrhizal type
- finding the majority type for each site
- using NMDS for clustering and seeing if there are trends/patterns
- predicting mycorrhizal type by precipitation, soil ph (big one), soil moisture, geography, other climate factors
- using temporary sites for testing
